Types of array traversals

Unsorted Arrays

Using a Collection (like HashMap/HashSet/Stack/Oueueetc ) is applicable when the problem needs you to:
find a pair/group of numbers satisfying a given target condition, for eg; find two number in the
array that sum up to a given target number

Sorting is applicable when the problem need you to:
Find a single value or a transformation of the given in some ways.

Two Pointers
is applicable when the problem needs you to:
search set of elements with a given condition, for eg: container with most water
find triplets or a sub array with a given condition

Fast and Slow Pointer is applicable when the problem needs you to:
find the position of an elernent or the length of the array, where the array is cycEc/has a loop

Two Heaps is applicable when the problem needs you to:
find the smallest/largest/me&amp;n of elements of an array

Subsets is applicable when the problem needs you to:
permutation and combination of the set

Top K Elements is appEcable when the problem needs you to:
find the top K elemetts of the array

Sliding Window is applicable when the problem needs you to:
• find the shortest / longest subset of the given array

Merge Interval' is appEcabIe when the problem needs you to:
find overlapping intervals/ mutually exclusive intervals/mergeintervab
given the input is a list/arrayof intervals [tl,t2]

Backtracking is applicable when the problem needs you to:
Find some permutations or combinations of the array elements.

Dynamic Programming when none of the above applies.


Sorted Arrays
Binary Search is applicablewhen the problem needs you to:
find a certain element in the given sorted array, for eg: find a given number in a
sorted array
Two Pointers
is applicable when the problem needs you to:
• search setof elements with a given condition, for eg: find two numberin a "sorted'
array that sum up to a given target number
• find triplets or a sub array with a given condition
Cyclic Sort is applicable when the problem needs you to:
find missing/duplicate/smallest number, where elements of the array are in a given
range,
Merge is the problem needs you to:
find the smallest/largest/ora specified element from N sorted arrays
Dynamic Programming when none of the above appliest
for eg: maximum subarray
